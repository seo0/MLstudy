"""
Your task today is to implement two functions using the LinkedBinaryTree class.
The first function (build_UNIST_tree) simply returns the organisational structure of schools and departments at UNIST.
The second function (LCA) finds the common ancestor in a tree of two positions.

- Implement the first function
- check the main to test your implementation
- Implement the second function
- Complete the main to test your implementation of the second function

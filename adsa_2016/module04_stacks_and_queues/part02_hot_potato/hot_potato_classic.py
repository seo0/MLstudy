"""
THE HOT POTATO GAME:
In this game children line up in a circle and pass an item from neighbor to neighbor as fast as they can.
At a certain point in the game, the action is stopped and the child who has the item (the potato)
is removed from the circle. Play continues until only one child (i.e., the winner) is left.

We will implement a general simulation of the Hot Potato game:
Our program will input a list of names and a constant, call it “num,” to be used for counting.
It will return the name of the last person remaining after repetitive counting by num.
What happens at that point is up to you :)

To simulate the circle, we will use a queue.
Assume that the child holding the potato will be at the front of the queue.
Upon passing the potato, the simulation will simply dequeue and then immediately enqueue that child,
putting her at the end of the line. She will then wait until all the others have been at the front before it will
be her turn again. After num dequeue/enqueue operations, the child at the front will be removed permanently
(i.e., eliminated from the game) and
another cycle will begin. This process will continue until only one name remains (i.e., the size of the queue is 1).

Good luck!

"""
Your task today is to complete the functions below, which do some sort of simple information retrieval
from a stream of tweets stored in a file
# More info about the Twitter API at: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api

    This function should print on console and return the tweet in output_file tweeted by the user with most followers,
     the name of the user, and the user's number of followers

    the most since joining twitter.

def lexical_complexity_tweet_stream(output_file, metric, weights):
    """
    This function returns the value of the lexicaly complexity, measured by the metric "metric", of tweets
    contained in output_file

    Note that you will have to import the code tha you have developed in module10 part01 to complete this function

    Suggestion: create a string by concatenating all the tweets stored. Then conevrt this string into
    a nltk "text" that you can pass as a parameter to the metrics defined in module10

    :param output_file: a file containing tracked tweet(s)
    :param metric: a lexical complexity metric (metric 1, 2, or 3, see module 10)
    :param weights: a list containing the weights (parameters) required by the chosen metric (see module 10)
